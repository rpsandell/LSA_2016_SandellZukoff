Data and Learning Simulations on for "The Development of the Germanic Preterite System"

Includes four files:

1. a Praat distributions file (GermanicDist_Final.txt), giving the "adult" winners on which a first generation of agents will be trained, and the type frequencies in Gothic of those forms.

2. a .Collection file (GermanicInput_Final.Collection) with Praat-readable tableaux and pair distributions.

3. a tab-separated values file (GermanicInput_Final.txt) of the tableaux that can be edited and used to
produce a .Collection file (we recommend using OT-Help v. 1.2: http://people.umass.edu/othelp/)

4. a Praat script (GermanicPreteritesLearningScript.txt) for running learning simulations.
